A. Data Sources

Demographic data can be obtained via "https://neighborhoods.dmagazine.com/" whereas location data (coordinates) can be obtained using https://www.latlong.net/ as this information is not readily available for Dallas region.
B. Data Usage

Dataframes will be created using pandas library in python to merge the information found in the above to data sets. Folium library will be used to visualize these on a geographical map followed by K_means clustering to identify similarity of neighborhoods. FOURSQUARE API will be used to determine local venues based on the clusters. Once the data is available, this can allow us to visualize whether a certain type of food is over or undersaturated. Meaning, does a market exist for the type of food we would like to introuce in Dallas area.
